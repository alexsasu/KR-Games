# KR-Games

Laboratory projects for the Artificial Intelligence course, Knowledge Representation part, taken in the 2nd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. The course's teacher was Florentina Hristea, and the laboratory teacher, Irina Ciocan.

The main goal of the projects was to use the **Alpha-beta pruning** and the **Minimax** algorithms.

The Modified Tic Tac Toe game is different from the basic Tic Tac Toe game in the following ways:
- the game table can have different dimensions besides 3x3
- in order for a player to win, at the end of the game, they must have more symbols of their type on the board than their opponent, instead of having 3 symbols of their type vertically, horizontally, or diagonally
- when there are 4 of the player's symbols around an empty block, the empty block will be populated with the player's symbol
- the game ends when the table is filled with symbols
- if at the end of the game both players have the same amount of symbols, the game ends in a tie
